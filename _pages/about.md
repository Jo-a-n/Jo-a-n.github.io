    <p>I believe in the uniqueness of human experience and its right to be respected and expressed.</p>
    <p class="mb-5">People are almost always multitasking, trying to balance thoughts, acts, emotions and interactions. <br><b>A good tech application for me, is the one that bridges and eases those complexities.</b></p>
  
    <p>I graduated as an Architect from the Polytechnic School of Athens (NTUA). Working as an architect, I explored my interest in <b>interactions</b> and the ways in which <b>different complex user needs, can be facilitated in one environment</b>. The focus on user needs and experiences and the importance of teamwork, have been great attributes later on to my practice as a designer of virtual environments. Currently, I design as part of a web development team.</p>
