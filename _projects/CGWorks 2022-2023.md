        <p>During my time at CGWORKS from 2022 to 2023, I served as the sole UI/UX designer, collaborating closely with developers to bring to life <b>a diverse range of web applications, e-commerce websites, and other complex projects</b> that are currently under development and not yet published. Together with the development team, I played a pivotal role in organizing and implementing a comprehensive design system, ensuring consistency and efficiency across all interfaces. <br><br>Although the specific details and visuals of these projects remain confidential, I take pride in the invaluable knowledge I gained through teamwork and collaboration, as well as my contributions to creating exceptional user experiences and fostering seamless collaboration between design and development teams.</p>
