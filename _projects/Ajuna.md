        <p>Collaborating with Ajuna team, CGWorks undertook the creation of ajuna.io</p>
        <p>Ajuna is a blockchain solution for web3 gaming. As the UI/UX designer on CGWorks I <b>communicated with the team, iterated on designs</b>, created <b>graphic elements</b> and presentations. Working together we created new pages -and polished existing pages- aiming for a better user experience.</p>
        <p><b>Project goals and brand presentation</b> were defined and organised in meetings with the Ajuna team.<br>Project mockups and prototype were iterated in Figma.</p>
