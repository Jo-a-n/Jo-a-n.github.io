        <p>NGS was designed to empower concious choices by being part of the user's daily routine.<br>Here how this works:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-3 col-lg-8 text-left">
        <li>It has simple rules, so it's easy to use from the very beginning.</li>
        <li>Even if you miss a day, you can always go back and fill it in. You don't need to remember many details like in a weekly food diary.</li>
        <li>Filling the questionnaire takes less than 1 minute.</li>
        <li>It doesn't have specific foods, so there are no restrictions for holidays like Christmas, Easter, special occasions, etc.</li>
        <li>You can constantly do a quick self-assessment of your day.</li>
