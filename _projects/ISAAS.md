        <p>ISaaS is an Asset and Infrastucture Management tool for highways in Greece. Through the platform the asssigned construction company can <b>coordinate the project and manage the timelines and restrictions of all involved resources</b>. As an Infrastructure Management Saas the platform can be used to track and manage any maintenance tasks needed for the highway, as well as any ongoing repair tasks.</p>
        <p>I worked along the lead UX designer of the project (Theodoros Theodoridis) delivering the <b>UI design</b> and graphic elements of the project, as well as the UX design of specific platform sections.</p>
        <p>This project is under development and protected by an NDA so here is an overview in figma of the multitude of the screen surrounding the user flow. ;)</p>
