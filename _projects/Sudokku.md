        <p>Sudokku is a <b>PaaS</b> (platform as a service) for <b>hosting and deploying web apps utilizing git repositories.</b></p> 
        <p>Sudokku has been a happy and rewarding challenge so far, requiring <b>knowledge of technical processes</b>, the <b>creation of a scalable IA</b>, and <b>a proactive approach to organising and conducting fitting user research and testing practices</b>.</p>
        <p>As the project had no established user flow on its way to a beta, I collaborated with the development team to conduct <b>user research</b> and a <b>competitive audit</b>, creating an effective user flow within 2 weeks. As the project continues, we are iterating on designs through <b>user testing interviews</b>, challenging our initial assumptions, and proactively addressing user needs that may have been overlooked.</p>
