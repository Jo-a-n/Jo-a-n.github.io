        <p>This project was developed and completed from CGWORKS.</p>
        <p>I joined the CGWorks team in the early stages of development of the project. My main contribution was the <b>discovery and improvement of any discovered UX pain points</b>. I re-designed the product cards and the established checkout process, streamlining the <b>user experience.</b></p>
