"The project of the Dipylon Society entitled ''Walk to Plato’s Academy'' is an audiovisual web app (audio tour) offering an exciting philosophical, archaeological and educational walk in the modern area of Plato’s Academy. This original walk is designed for children and grownups and lasts about 2 hours, with all necessary stops.

Following an alternative route in the city of Athens, the 21st-century traveler walks along the traces of the ancient road that connected the ancient Kerameikos with the Academy. Having as a starting point the main entrance to the ancient city, the Dipylon Gate, the modern traveler ends up in the area of the ancient Gymnasium and the Philosophical School of Plato, where they are guided around the visible antiquities within the renowned grove of the Academy."

<!-- The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

```
